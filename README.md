## üöß What's Missing?  
- **Graphics Acceleration**: Integrated Intel UHD Graphics are not fully accelerated, resulting in reduced performance for graphic-heavy tasks.  
- **Wi-Fi Support**: No driver available for the Realtek wireless card. You might need a USB Wi-Fi dongle or compatible PCIe card for wireless connectivity.  
- **SMBIOS Configuration**: You'll need to customize your SMBIOS for iCloud and App Store functionality.  

> Use [GenSMBIOS](https://github.com/corpnewt/GenSMBIOS) to generate and customize a valid SMBIOS.

## üîß Installation  

1. **Prepare USB:**  
   - Format your USB drive as `MacOS Extended (Journaled)` with a GUID partition table.  
   - Create a bootable macOS installer using Terminal (refer to [this guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/)).

2. **Copy EFI Folder:**  
   - Replace the default EFI folder on your USB with the one provided in this repository.  

3. **Customize SMBIOS:**  
   - Open `config.plist` with [ProperTree](https://github.com/corpnewt/ProperTree) and generate a new SMBIOS.  
   - Choose a suitable model (e.g., MacBook Air 2020) for best compatibility with macOS services like iCloud and App Store.

4. **BIOS Settings:**  
   - **Disable Secure Boot** in BIOS.  
   - Set SATA mode to **AHCI** for storage devices.  
   - Set Boot Mode to **UEFI**.  
   - Disable **Fast Boot** if necessary.

## üå∏ Recommendations  

- **Graphics Acceleration**: Since graphics acceleration is not functional, avoid heavy graphic tasks. Keep an eye out for future updates to OpenCore and kexts for possible support.  
- **Wi-Fi Support**: Replace the Realtek Wi-Fi card with a compatible one like the **Broadcom BCM94360NG** or use a USB Wi-Fi dongle.  
- **Audio**: Ensure you install necessary kexts for audio functionality if sound is not working. Look into **AppleALC** or **VoodooHDA** kexts based on your needs.  
- **USB Devices**: If USB ports are not working, ensure USB mapping is correctly set up in `config.plist` and try the **USBInjectAll.kext**.
